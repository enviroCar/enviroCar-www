								competing to become the most efficient driver. Furthermore, enviroCar enables you to contribute data collected 
								by your car to the open enviroCar community. <br/><br/>From those data,	enviroCar generates information about 
								traffic in your city and its emissions on our streets. The information will support e.g. urban planners to improve
								traffic light phases or to clarify the impact of traffic calming measures. <br/>enviroCar is the first platform to

<strong>enviroCar</strong> is a community based platform for gathering car-borne sensor data and producing environmental information. Access the car’s sensors with your <strong>Android smartphone</strong> and a <strong>Bluetooth OBD-II adapter</strong>. The <strong>enviroCar app</strong> provides information about your car and your driving characteristics. Upload the data to the <strong>enviroCar server</strong> and contribute anonymized data to the open enviroCar citizen science community. The <strong>enviroCar website</strong> allows you to:
<ul>
<li>access your data,</li>
<li>compare your driving characteristics with others,</li>
<li>explore maps and statistics and</li>
<li>download data to process and analyze.</li>
</ul>

enviroCar uses standard Bluetooth OBD-II adapters, such as the Drivedeck Sport. Plug the OBD-II adapter into your car, connect it with your Android smartphone using Bluetooth, start the enviroCar app and off you go collecting data for a new track! The enviroCar app automatically reads out parameters, such as  speed or revolution per minutes and calculates further information such as fuel consumption and CO2 emissions.';

In Europe, the following cars are equipped with an OBD-II interface:

The tracks are also available to others as anonymous open data, i.e.  any reference to the user - you - is inaccessible. Of course, all communication between website/app and the enviroCar server is encrypted to prevent eavesdropping.
<br/><br/>
Furthermore, the app enables you to conceal the start and destination of your tracks, as long as you have not deactivated this function. This is achieved by cutting off the first and the last 250 meters of each track, or the distance, which was driven within the first and the last measured minute. This function prevents the linkage of tracks to specific home addresses or business addresses.

<strong>1. What happens to User Data</strong> 
<br/>
When using this website, your IP address will be stored  in our server’s access log and error log file.
<br/><br/>
When you register for or use the enviroCar services, the following information will be collected and stored. This information is deleted when you delete your account.
</p>
<ul>
<li>The user name you chose</li>
<li>The email address you provided</li>
<li>The password you provided</li>
<li>The user name of persons who added your user name as a friend</li>
<li>The user name of the person you added as a friend</li>

Any other information you provided in a free text form</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify">
You can delete (there is no way back!) your account and the data associated with it (see above) at anytime. Tracks that have been uploaded as Open Data and published to the public are NOT deleted. If you would like to delete your tracks as well, you must do this before you delete your account. Once your account is gone, it is not possible to find out which tracks were yours. Please read the FAQ <LINK> for more information about how to delete your data and/or your account.
</p>       
<br/>
<strong>2. Saving data during a drive</strong> 
<br/>
<p style="text-align: justify">
During your test drive (after the START button has been pushed until the STOP button has been pushed), the following data is collected and saved:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Location of measurement</li>
<li>Time and date of measurement</li>
<li>Data from the engine control system, for example speed, revolutions per minute, throttle pedal position</li>
<li>Derived data, such as fuel consumption, CO2 emission</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify">
This data is linked via an encrypted key to your user account, which enables you to view your own data in the enviroCar App and on the website. Communication between the enviroCar App, the enviroCar server and the enviroCar website is encrypted so that no third party can access your data.
</p>
<br/>
<strong>3. Upload data to enviroCar server</strong> 
<br/>
<p style="text-align: justify">
When you upload your data to the enviroCar server (option: “upload data as Open Data“), you agree to publish the measured data as anonymous Open Data and allow third parties to use the data in accordance with the Open Database License (ODbL).
Data which is downloaded from the enviroCar server contains no user information. The enviroCar App has an option in “settings” with which you can cut off the beginning and end of your tracks so that the point of departure and the destination are obscured.

<br/>
<strong>4. Licensing</strong> 
<br/>
<p style="text-align: justify">
Data available via the enviroCar API can be used by third parties in accordance with the Open Database License <a href="http://opendatacommons.org/licenses/odbl/1.0/" target="_blank">ODbL</a>. This means
